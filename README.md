# ✿ Sofía minaya — Personal portfolio

> _花が咲いたよ — The flower has bloomed._

My little corner of the internet. A personal portfolio built from scratch with a lot of love, too many coffees, and a genuine desire to show who I am — not just what I can do.

---

## ✦ What's this about

This is my portfolio as a **junior full-stack developer** making her way into the industry after transitioning from hospitality. It's designed to feel personal, intentional, and just a little bit different from the usual dev portfolio template.

## ✦ What's inside

The site has three main sections, all living inside a single smooth-scrolling experience:

**Hero** — animated typewriter intro that changes depending on which section you're exploring. Backed by a WebGL iridescent shader because why not.

**Work** — a horizontal scrolling carousel of my projects, with a rewind animation I'm unreasonably proud of. Plus a looping tech band showing the tools I work with.

**About** — a bento grid with a live clock (Granada time, always), a spinning vinyl linked to my actual coding playlist, pixel art self-portrait, fun facts, and animated counters.

The **footer** reveals itself as you scroll down — fading in and expanding from the bottom like it's peeking out from under the page.

## ✦ A note on me

I came from hospitality. I know how to work under pressure, read a room, and make people feel welcome — turns out those skills translate surprisingly well to building things for humans to use.

I'm analytical, detail-oriented, and I genuinely enjoy the creative problem-solving that comes with frontend development. I also draw, game, cook fusion food, and I'am slowly learning Japanese.

If you're looking for someone curious, resilient, and ready to grow fast — hi, that's me 👩‍💻
